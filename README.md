##    OSI-MULTI-PLATFORM-PROJECT

A complete multi-platform OSI model simulation involving:
```

Client (C program)

Server (C program)

User Application (Python)
```

The Client and Server each implement a full 7-layer OSI stack (encapsulation + decapsulation).
The Python user application visualizes the communication by printing OSI layer progress after every 2 layers are completed (zip-zag style).

#    Project Overview

This project demonstrates multi-platform communication using OSI principles:

Client (C)

Encapsulates message through each OSI layer.

Sends structured data (JSON format) to the server.

Receives reply from server and decapsulates.

Server (C)

Receives encapsulated message.

Decapsulates through 7 OSI layers.

Re-encapsulates reply and sends back.

User Application (Python)

Connects to Client.

Receives OSI layer logs.

Prints OSI flow two layers at a time:

Example output:
```

[TX]
Application → Presentation
  ✔ Layers 1-2 completed

Session → Transport
  ✔ Layers 3-4 completed

Network → DataLink
  ✔ Layers 5-6 completed

Physical
  ✔ Layer 7 completed
```

This is your requested zip-zag visualization.

#    OSI Layers Implemented

The following layers are simulated:
```

Application

Presentation

Session

Transport

Network

DataLink

Physical
```

Each layer has:
```
LayerName_encapsulate()
LayerName_decapsulate()
```

Registered inside layers.c.

#    How It Works
1️Client → Server (TX Flow)
```
Application
Presentation
Session
Transport
Network
DataLink
Physical
```

Each layer adds a header.

2️Server processing (RX → process → TX)

The server:
```

Decapsulates

Processes data

Re-encapsulates a response

Sends back to client
```

3️Python App displays ZIP-ZAG

The Python user app reads:
```
{
  "direction": "TX",
  "layers": ["Application", "Presentation", ...],
  "payload": "Hello"
}
```

And prints two layers at a time.

#    Build Instructions
Build Server
```
cd server
make
```

Build Client
```
cd client
make
```

Run Instructions
Start Server
```
./server
```
Start Client
```
./client
```
Start Python Application
```
python3 python_app.py
```

#    Communication Flow
Python User App  ⇄  Client (C OSI stack) ⇄ Server (C OSI stack)


Python only receives logs and visualizes progress.

All OSI logic is performed in C on both ends.

#    Technologies Used
```

C (Server/Client networking + OSI stack)

Python 3 (User-level visualization)

POSIX Sockets

JSON text protocol
```

#    Future Enhancements
```

Color-coded terminal layers

Retransmission & packet corruption simulation

Multithreaded server

UDP mode

Real NIC info injection
```
